Based on the data I've compiled, it appears that DuckDuckGo is a less effective search engine than Google. The average Spearman coefficient 
over all queries was -11.13 with an average percent overlap of 20%. The fact that the search result list produced a negative Spearman 
coefficient clearly indicates that the overlapping results were (from this perspective) uncorrelated. And it points to their ranking algorithms 
differing substantially when it comes to determine the relevance of results to the query. Futhermore, seeing as only a fifth of the results 
overlapped, their really isn't much of a relationshp in the way the search engines gather top results either. If Google is the standard we're holding
DuckDuckGo relative to, then based on this sample size (10 search results), DuckDuckGo does not quite perform as well as Google. Perhaps over 
a larger result pool (say 50 or so) the Spearman coefficient could turn positive and the percent overlap would increase. Regardless, it is clear 
from the data that the two search engines prioritize different ranking features.
